fork of xolox coloredlogs with possibility to log to travis and jupyter

since the parameter *isatty* is not behaving like expected (should FORCE) color, the original version does
not show colors on travis and jupyter(stdout).

with that version You can have colored logs on jupyter and travis.

I hope Peter accepts my PullRequest, then I can delete this stripped (no tests) Version ...
